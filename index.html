    <header><h1>My Favourite Hobby</h1></header>
    <main>
      <section><h2>Introduction</h2><p>One of my favorite hobbies is spending quiet moments reading novels,
        especially fiction books that take me to new worlds and spark my imagination. I love finding a peaceful spot in a public garden,
        laying on the soft grass, and getting lost in a good story while surrounded by nature. Taking walks through the gardens helps me relax and clear my mind,
        making my reading time even more enjoyable and inspiring.</p></section>
